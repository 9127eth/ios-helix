Below are the requirements for the initial firestoredocument that is added to a user when they sign up.

When a user signs up, we need to add a document to their collection. We will use the firebase auth id as the document id.
This is is known as the users userId.

The fields for the document are as follows:
    createdAt
    ""
    (string)


    isPro
    defaults to false
    (boolean)


    primaryCardId
    "[username]"
    (string)


    primaryCardPlaceholder
   defaults to true
    (boolean)


    stripeCustomerId
    ""
    (string)


    stripeSubscriptionId
    ""
    (string)


    updatedAt
    ""
    (string)


    username
    "[unique 5 character string]"

The username is a unique 5 character string that is generated for the user. It is used in the url to access the user's business card. It must be unique so when creating a username, we need to check if it already exists. If it does, we need to generate a new one.

These requirements are only for when a user first creates their account.
